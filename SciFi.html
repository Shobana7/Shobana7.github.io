	                 Science Fiction permeates our world,culture and lives. Scientists are in favour of these thing  whereas a person 
	          with less scientific knowledge calls it as pure stupidity. The genre of science fiction pushes against, scrambles up, 
	          and attempts to climb over the obstacles that existence thrusts upon us in our search for the answers and meanings to 
	          what it means to be human.

    	              Science fiction belongs to a genre of writing called speculative fiction, which also includes fantasy. Perhaps 
    	       the easiest way to define Speculative Fiction is all stories that take place in a setting contrary to known reality.
    	       Which include:
                  1. Any story set in the future, beings future technologies cannot be known. 
                  2. Alternate world stories, or stories set in a past that contradicts historical fact. 
                  3. Stories set on earth before recorded history.
                  4. Stories that contradict a known or supposed law of nature.
               Stories set in worlds that follow our rules are Sci-fi. If it is set in an universe that doesn't follow our rules
               it's fantasy.

     Many sci-fi stories fall into several of the above categories. Star Wars for example takes place in an 
 alternate world.It also has elements that contradict laws of nature, such as The Force, or sound in space. 
 Other sf stories fall into only a single of the categories and to further confuse things some stories that fall 
 into those categories are not consider sci-fi at all .
     What would Star Wars be without the screeching of Tie Fighters, or buzz of proton torpedoes as they cut through 
 space? Sometimes it becomes necessary for a writer to break scientific laws in order to appeal to the audience or for 
 story its self to work. Beings most writers don't expect their audiences to be astrophysicists, it is easy to fool 
 them by bending the rules little bit.

    	The gap between scientific theory and practice is exploited to create a world, or at least circumstances, very different 
   from our own reality. Some kind of scientific explanation are provided as to how the fantastic things have been made possible. 
   H. G. Wells was a great science fiction writer and he had many different styles and beliefs that were reflected into his
   writings.Wells is known for being the  "Father of Science Fiction" over such great science fiction writers as Jules Verne. This 
   is the author that made known the idea of a machine that could travel through time and Martians invading earth and the idea of 
   invisibility.
    	       
    	The whole entertinment industry revolves around this;in all its forms:novels, television,movies,art,music etc. In this
   century,every kid and teenager is obsessed with scci-fi. Many scientists have now turned themselves into writing about possible 
   future technologies. With the use of graphics, a lot of future physics and concepts have become understandable.
